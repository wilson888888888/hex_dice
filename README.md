# hex_dice
So if you have this hexagon right
and each of the six vertices are numbers 1-6
and then you roll a dice
and each roll of the dice you put a point on the hexagon halfway between the vertex you rolled and the previous point
you get what this program is simulating

it makes a cool pattern im sure you could use math to explain why if you really had nothing better to do

something to do with chaos theory and fractals and strange attractors and so on und so fort
